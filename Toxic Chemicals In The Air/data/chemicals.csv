It is also released into the air by combustion of coal and oil and by power plants. "
17,Mercury and its compounds,,Groups A,"Once mercury is released into the air it tends to settle in soil and sediments where it is changed to an organic form, methyl mercury, which biomagnifies or concentrates up the food chain, particularly the aquatic food chain. As a result, humans can be exposed to mercury (in the form of methyl mercury) when they consume fish and shellfish. Mercury is of concern to human health as it can have harmful effects throughout the body. Most notably, mercury is known as a potent human neurotoxin however, exposure has also been linked to an increased risk of reproductive toxicity and cardiovascular disease. Adverse effects on the nervous system are of increased concern for the fetus, infant and child as these subgroups are particularly vulnerable.<br><br>Possible sources: Mercury is used in the production of thermometers, barometers, batteries, dental amalgams, fluorescent lights and lubrication oils. It is also released in the combustion of fossil fuels in electric power generation. "

"
23,Nitrogen Oxides (NOx),11104-93-1,Group C,"NOx is the term used to describe a category of chemicals known as nitrogen oxides. The main source of NOx is human activity as a result of combustion of fossil fuels particularly from vehicles. NOx is produced by all combustion processes in the presence of air. Nitrogen dioxide, NO2, was identified as one of five common air pollutants of significant health concern that contributes to the burden of illness from air pollution in Toronto. Individuals are exposed by inhaling air that contains NO2. NO2 affects mainly the respiratory system. Exposure leads to a decrease in the lungs' ability to fight infection. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations are associated with daily mortality and hospital admissions as a result of respiratory disease. People with asthma and bronchitis, young children and adults with heart and respiratory disorders are especially sensitive to NO2 exposure.<br><br>Possible sources: Nitrogen oxides are released as a by-product of combustion and from some chemical processes. "
24,Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5),,Group C,"Particulate matter (PM) is a term used to describe solid and liquid particles found in the air we breathe. These particles are composed of acid aerosols, organic chemicals, smoke, metal fumes, fly ash, dust and pollen. PM that is smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter is called PM2.5. PM2.5 leads primarily to irritation of the eyes, throat and lungs. These particles may worsen the condition of those individuals who are afflicted by respiratory conditions, such as asthma, bronchitis, or lung disease, and also affects those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Children and the elderly have an increased sensitivity to PM. Particles may also reduce an individual's capacity to combat infection.<br><br>Possible sources: PM2.5 is released as a by-product of combustion and industrial processes. "
22,Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs),,Group B,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed as a result of incomplete burning of organic substances. PAHs are present in the environment as complex mixtures that are difficult to measure and identify. Some PAH-rich mixtures are carcinogenic and some are not. Similarly, some individual PAHs are carcinogenic, and some are not. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) was used as a surrogate for the group of PAHs when determining cancer potency, because it is the most toxic member of the PAH family of compounds. Individuals may be exposed to a number of PAHs through both ingestion and inhalation. Although food is the major source of exposure to PAHs, since PAHs are a more potent carcinogen when inhaled than ingested, the risk of lung cancer due to inhalation exposure may be higher than the risk of stomach cancer from oral intake.<br><br>Possible sources: PAHs are released as a by-product of combustion and certain industrial processes. They are a component of asphalt, coal tar and other bituminous products. "
19,Tetrachloroethylene (Perchloroethylene),127-18-4,Groups A,"Tetrachloroethylene is probably carcinogenic to humans. It has been linked to an increased risk of a variety of cancers in several systems of the human body, including both mononuclear cell leukemia and liver tumours. Individuals may experience this increased risk of cancer as a result of being chronically exposed to tetrchloroethylene by inhalation.<br><br>Possible sources: Tetrachloroethylene is widely used for dry-cleaning fabrics and textile processing. It is used as a chemical intermediate and in metal degreasing operations. It is also used in the manufacture of paint removers and printing inks, the formulation of adhesives and specialized cleaning fluids, and as aerosols and dye carriers. "
20,Trichloroethylene,079-01-6,Groups A,"Trichloroethylene is probably carcinogenic to humans. Individuals who are chronically exposed to low levels of trichloroethylene by inhalation, may experience an increased risk of liver, kidney or lung cancer.

25,Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Total,,Group C,"VOCs are a group of organic chemicals that easily evaporate into the air from their direct use, from products containing them, or as a by-product of industrial processes. VOCs react with other pollutants to create ozone, a major contributor to smog. Ozone has been associated with acute symptoms like coughing and wheezing as well as more chronic conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. In 2004, TPH reported that exposure to five common smog pollutants, including ozone, contributed to about 1,700 premature deaths and 6,000 hospitalizations of Toronto residents each year. While VOCs can act as precursors of smog, they can also be toxic and impact directly on human health. People who chronically breathe air contaminated with VOCs may experience an increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory problems.<br><br>Possible sources: VOCs easily evaporate into the air from their direct use, from products containing them or as by-products of industrial processes. Since there are many hundreds of VOCs it is somewhat difficult to summarize all possible sources. The most common sources however, include vehicle use, fossil fuel combustion, steel-making, petroleum refining, fuel-refilling, industrial and residential solvent use, paint application, manufacturing of synthetic materials (e.g. plastics, carpets), food processing, agricultural activities and wood processing and burning.
